      <h1>Connecticut Towns’ Child Care Price in Comparison to the U.S. Recommended Price</h1>

          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p class="lead"> According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, affordable child care should not exceed 7% of a family’s median household income. In Connecticut, that 7% threshold means that the median family, which earns $83,572, should spend no more than $5850 a year, or $112 weekly on child care. But this 7% recommendation makes no sense when we compare it to low-income towns like Hartford, where the median family in Hartford pays around 31% of their income on child care. The data from 211 ChildCare, tells us that the majority of families in Connecticut spend more than the suggested percentage on child care. While almost all towns in Connecticut surpass this suggested cost, some towns have a greater percentage point difference to the recommended 7%. Costs of child care in Connecticut towns are affecting families disproportionately, some towns spend a greater portion of the median household income, while other towns spend just a smaller fraction of the median household income on child care. Recognizing the towns in which the cost of child care is high in comparison to their median household income is important to our community from the Middlesex Coalition for Children and the Connecticut Early Childhood Alliance because it directs attention to the towns that need more affordable childcare education. By identifying towns that lack affordable child care our community partners can take initiative in creating budgeting programs that work towards getting Connecticut towns closer to that 7% threshold. 
  To better understand child care costs across different towns in Connecticut, our data story asked what percentage of Connecticut towns’ median household income is going towards child care. Overall, we present these key findings: Lower median household income towns like Hartford, Mansfield, Waterbury, New Haven, and Windham are spending a greater portion of their income on child care. Higher median household income towns like Weston, Wilton, New Canaan, Westport, and Darien, spend a lower percentage of their income on child care. As we see the discrepancies of cost of child care between high and low-income towns, we also must acknowledge that only two Connecticut towns do not exceed the 7% threshold of child care.

 <p>Figure 1 as seen above, shows the percent of median household income used on infant toddler child care.</p>


 <p>The map above shows the percentage of income spent on child care. This map tells a big part of the story because it shows which towns are meeting the reasonable expectation of the 7% of their median household income that should be spent on childcare. It is pretty evident from the map above that almost all of the towns in Connecticut do not have affordable childcare based on the median household income data.

<p>Figure 2 as seen above, the table shows all yearly median rate of infant-toddler child care in all Connecticut towns. </p> 

<p>The table above shows the median infant-toddler yearly rate for each town and the median household incomes in Connecticut. If we look at the top five towns with the lowest median household income they tend to have the largest percentage of their income go towards child care. This is important when discussing disposable income, which is the income leftover after paying for essential expenses. The towns that are paying large parts of their income towards child care do not have much leftover if they have other expenses like rent, utilities, or groceries. Disposable income is very important in a families budget, it offers households the ability to save money. By having large portions of income go to child care it puts households in a very tight financial budget.   The five towns with the highest median household income spend a lower percentage of their household income on child care. Weston, Wilton, New Canaan, Westport, and Darien all spend a significantly smaller percentage of their income on child care in comparison to the lower income towns. When we look at the wealthiest neighborhood, Weston, and compare it to the poorest town in Connecticut, Hartford, there is a 22 percentage point difference between the two towns. Although there is a difference between the high and low income towns in terms of cost towards child care, only two towns do not exceed the recommended 7%: Darien and New Canaan. This tells us that the majority of Connecticut towns do not have affordable child care.</p>

          <h2>Methods</h2>
          <p>Our cleaned-up data sheet of 211ChildCare data, clarifies the types of providers, the towns in which the providers are located, and the infant-toddler and preschool weekly uniform rate. The cleaned-up version of the 211ChildCare data helped us begin the process of analyzing patterns within our data. When we began working on this project, our initial goal was to find the percentage each town spent on child care based on their median household income. This question laid the groundwork for guiding our research within this project. With our cleaned-up data, we were able to create pivot tables that showed the median weekly rate of infant-toddler child care in each town. Once we created the pivot table we had to paste this information on a different tab, where we could sort and organize data. Within this new tab, we added the median household income which was data provided by Social Explorer and useddid a vlookup formula to match median household income with the correct town. 
  Before we began making maps and charts we needed to convert the median weekly rate into a yearly unit to compare the median household income and the costs of child care accurately. Once we normalized the weekly rate for infant and toddler care to a yearly amount, we could then calculate the percent of income spent on child care, w. Which was calculated by dividing the median yearly cost of infant-toddler child care by the median household income. We then made a map of those numbers to create a visual that supports our findings. We also used the data of the yearly rate of infants and toddlers and the median household income to create a stacked bar chart in Google Sheets that demonstrated what portion of the town's median household income was going toward child care.
  One uncertainty that arose while we were creating a pivot table that looked at the childcare providers in each town was that there were no recorded childcare providers in some of the Connecticut towns. This is not to say that 211ChildCare did not collect data from this town but that the town does not have childcare providers to collect data from. Although there may be no childcare provider for a town, there are still children within that town that need child care. A big uncertainty with our data as a whole is that it doesn’t account for people who take their child to a different town for child care. Let’s say a person who lives in Hartford has been taking their child to a daycare center in West Hartford;, this wouldn’t be accounted for in our data for West Hartford because they live in Hartford. This means that the percent of income spent on child care of a particular town may not accurately reflect the affordability of a family’s child care expenses living within that town.
